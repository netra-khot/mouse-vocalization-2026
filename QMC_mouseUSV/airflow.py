def airflow(pressure, glottal_area):
    """
    Port of airflow.m (mouse constants).

    Computes volumetric airflow through the glottis using subglottal
    pressure and glottal area, via jet speed and an empirical discharge
    coefficient correction.

    Args:
        pressure: tensor, subglottal pressure (Pa).
        glottal_area: tensor, glottal cross-sectional area (m^2).

    Returns:
        Tensor of volumetric airflow, broadcast shape of inputs.
